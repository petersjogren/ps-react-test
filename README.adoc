:toc: preamble

This project was created to explore implementation architecture and concepts for a graph editor web application as well as learning new concepts of modern web development. It was created with Create React App so the usual install and build scripts apply.

This document will both contain obvious things and concepts which I prefer having seen many types of architectures of complicated desktop computer software and experienced the problems and advantages of different methods.

NOTE: Don't mind the graphic design. It is just an example.

Overview
--------
This is a React + Redux project using various npm packages for implementing an example graph editor and providing examples of how to solve different kinds of problems that will arise during the development of a graph editor web app. 

It aims to use node types in plain HTML where any HTML element can be used while drawing connection graphics in a SVG layer below the HTML div.

A example websocket server is also provided to illustrate sync functionality between web client and a server.

Usage
-----

. Install link:https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js]
. Clone this repository
. cd into that repository directory
. Type `npm install`
. To start the web app on localhost:3000 type `npm start`
. In another terminal window start the example server by typing `node websocket-test-server.js`

Functionality
-------------

Nodes as HTML
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Nodes (the InOutNode.js component) are placed in the div with className `graphicsarea`. The node itself is an example that the node can be any HTML with divs, flex positioning, mouseovers, mousedown, mouseup operations etc. 

The list of input and output ports in the a node in the state are rendered with the functional components InPort and OutPort.

Two exported functions gives the relative positions of the ports relative the upper left position of the node.

Nodes support drag operations from the out ports to the inports. See <<DragDrop>>.

Connections in SVG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connections are drawn in an SVG area which has the same coordinate system as the HTML div area. The functions `inPortRelativePosition` and `outPortRelativePosition` are used to find out the relative position of the ports to the upper left (x,y) position of the node. The BezierCurve component is used to drag a curve between the two positions. The connection drawing is completely independant from the nodes - only the node position and port relative positions are used. Since the nodes report their positions even during a drag move operation the connections are always drawn between the ports of the two nodes.

HTML div and SVG area move together
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An SVG area fills up the entire editor div. It does not use the viewport argument for knowing what to display. scale() and translate() css is used instead. This way a div can be placed at the exact same area as the svg and all HTML parts of nodes etc can be in the HTML layer. The SVG area can contain the connection graphics etc. They are both in the same coordinate system thanks to the scale and translate CSS attributes.

In the div ordinary HTML elements can be placed. They can be absolutely positioned
so this means that nodes with HTML text, diagrams etc can live together in the
same area as the nodes.

The div has CSS property `overflow: visible` to be able to place the div
at the correct origo and still be able to see everything in it at the correct position.

SVG foreignObject does not work properly in Safari. It would otherwise be
a good idea to have all HTML in the SVG area but inside a foreignObject.

Positioning of HTML elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The component `Draggable` in the `react-draggable` package is used to position the nodes. The position is the upper left corner of the node.

`Draggable` has a prop (handle) to let only the areas within a certain HTML tag be the handle that the user can move the node with.

`display: flex` layout is used in the different rows to keep the squares at the ends and the middle areas flexible.

CSS styling
~~~~~~~~~~~

Various CSS styling techniques are used to style the nodes. The `noselect` class is used to not let the HTML text be selectable.

Border radius is set to get the rounded corners and `overflow: hidden` is used to not show the part of the HTML elements that goes outside of the rounded border.

Stress test
~~~~~~~~~~~
A button called Stress Test can be pressed. It will then add a lot of nodes to the graph editor and when a node is dragged many nodes follow. This is to test the speed of the drag operations and the rendering.

Sync button
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Sync button will go through all nodes and connections in the client that is not `confirmed` by the server and issue `addnode` and `addconnection` server commands to add them. 

Nodes and connections are rendered with a red border when they are unconfirmed and with a black border when they are confirmed.

See <<Confirm>>

Measure HTML components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a React component should have a width or height which depends on the text
inside the component the width (e.g.) can not be directly controlled by
the state since the width is not known.

The component can be measured by creating a hidden div and let ReactDOM render the component
in that and then measure the resulting div to get the correct width.

link:https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html[React.createRef] can also be useful for this.

The measure function could be memoized so that it directly returns
the correct width for props it has rendered before.

Movable nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The InOutNode components are made movable by wrapping the HTML with the `Draggable` component.

Nodes as controlled React components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The nodes will have an internal state during the drag operation but they also report the position with the props function onDrag so the nodes will be a link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42522515/what-are-controlled-components-and-uncontrolled-components[controlled component]. A controlled component makes sure that the entire state of the component can be maintained elsewhere at all times.

Single app state to make each React component indepenent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each React component are independent from any other React component. It is provided props from the Redux state (possibly via some other React component above it in the hierarky). Its only responsibility is to render itself (i.e. provide the correct link:https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html[JSX]) from the provided props and to fire the correct function props when the user interacts with the component by e.g. clicking the mouse.

Example: The nodes (InOutNode.js) and the connections (BezierCurve.js) is completely unaware of each other and can be developed separately.

Operations as pure functions on state
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you follow the idea that all state in the application is in the
Redux store, development is just a matter of rendering different states.
You can think through all possible states for a component and test that it
renders correctly for all of them and then the development is done.

The functionality operates on the state to produce different variations
of state. Then you know that the algorithm is correct by just looking at
the components and how they render.

Chrome Dev Tools has a debugger so you can set breakpoints. Go into the Sources tab.

Testable since operations operate on state
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The application state is kept in the Redux store. There is no other state in the application. This means that every action possible in the program resides in the redux/acions/index.js file and all the state manipulation because of an action is keps in the redux/reducers/index.js. This in turn means that every user action can be simulated in an automatic test that starts with a state and use the action creators in redux/actions/index.js and the reducer function in redux/reducers/index.js to mutate the state and then checking that the is as expected afterwards.

Load/Save just loads/saves state
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the top area with the Load and Save buttons the application state can be persisted to/from files on the client computer. A simple JSON.stringify(state) can be saved in the file and state can be set to JSON.parse(fileContent) when issuing a Load operation.

The Save operation can possibly filter out some unimportant parts from the state and set them to default values when Loading.

NOTE: Take care to implement a version number on the saved JSON format to habndle future changes. When loading a document the version should always be checked and a conversion function can be called to convert an older version of the document to the new state format be setting the correct default values etc.

Node type template files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an example of asynchronous operations the node templates can be loaded with buttons from file URLs.
The two node template files are located in the public/templates directory.

The node types in the list is currently only InOuNodes with different titles but they can in principle be any node type if that is implemented (s.a. text nodes, image nodes etc). The entry for the node in the nodelist is the same javascript object as should be inserted inte the `nodes` section in the app state.

HTML drag/drop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Works on every HTML element.

Trick can be used to not show any image during drag (see git history).

Nice API with payload and ondrag/ondrop/ondragover.

Does not work in iOS so not used in project (but user earlier - see git history) ! 

Implemented instead with handling of mouse events. To make this work on touch devices ontouchstart etc event handlers should be used instead. Touch events are not currently used in the project.

[[DragDrop]]
Drag from out port to in port to make connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

User can drag from the little arrow on the out port row of a node to the little arrow on the in port of another node. This operation works like this:

These things in the state are used:
- `isDragInProgress`
- `dragPayload`
- `dragMousePosition`

. The out port area on an InOutNode has an onMouseDown event handler and will fire the `onOutportDragStarted` function when the mouse is clicked. This will fire the `outportDragStartedAction` action and the reducer will set the `isDragInProgress` to true and fill in the `dragPayload` section of the state with the from node index and out port index.
. The graphics area has an onMouseMove event handler that will fire a `dragMousePositionAction` if `isDragInProgress` is true so the `dragMousePosition` section in the state is updated.
. The in port has an onMouseUp event handler that will fire an `onInportDrop` and then an `inportDropAction` which will look at the `dragPayload` and connect the two ports by updating the Redux state accordingly.

So in other words the state will reflect if a drag operation is in progress by looking at `isDragInProgress` and it will find out from which out port (and therefore the (x,y) position) the drag started by looking at `dragPayload` and the mouse position during the drag operation is found in `dragMousePosition`.

So during the drag operation the state of the operation is visualized by a BezierCurve from the drag start postion to the mouse position. This code can be found in the GrahicsAreaPureHTML.js file.

React only updates DOM if DOM is different from before
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the state is changed React renders everything again to its virtual DOM and compares with the previous virtual DOM to find out what is actually changed. Then it does only the neccessary DOM changes in the browser.

React always renders and smart diff before DOM change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

React uses a smart and fast diff algorithm to compare the two versions of the virtual DOMs.

React render optimizations by using shouldComponentUpdate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only call render function when necessary if the render function takes time. If the render does not take much time you can rely on the React diff algorithm that makes sure the DOM is only updated when a DOM element is different from the last time React did a render.

extend React.Purcomponent instead of React.Component if your React component only uses props with plain javascript values (i.e. not objects). PureComponent does a shallow equality check to see if the props are different from the last props. If they are equal the render function is not called at all. This is good for performance.

shouldComponentUpdate can be overridden explicitly instead. This function does equality check between new props and current props. Tells if component should be rendered. Good to use when comparison can't be shallow (use PureComponent in that case). Or if it has arrow function props that is different from time to time but essentially the same. Example: InOutNode.js

Make sure to not create new javascript objects each time and provide
them as props. Ref equality checks === will not be true since it is
two different objects but with the same values. To prevent rendering
to happen each value must be checked and no reference checks of objects.
If Immutable.js is used care must be taken to use equals or Immutable.is instead
of ref equality checks. See Immutable.js documentation.

React has smart diff algorithm to just do the changes in the DOM that are necessary.

Put console.log() calls in render functions to check that components does not call render when it shouln't.

There is also a function in React Dev Tools to blink a component when it renders.

Redux description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Redux is a way to structure applications to completely separate rendering, actions and state mutation.

Read about the principles of Redux here: link:https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles/[The Three Principles of Redux]

The application state is kept in one place called the Redux Store. The store state is read-only and is provided to the React App via the `Provider` component in the index.js file.

A React component can be connected to Redux by the Redux `connect` function. This will take two functions. One that controls which part of the state is provided as props to the component (`mapStateToProps`) and one that provides the functionality of the callback functions as props to the component (`mapDispatchToProps`).

Every component doesn't have to be connected. They can also take props and callback functions as usual but they will eventually be provided the props from a component higher up in component hierarky.

The `mapDispatchToProps` function has access to the Redux `dispatch` function that is used to dispatch actions. This is the only way for the React components to affect the state. This way it will become very clear what actions are possible in the aplication. Just look in the redux/actions/index.js file.

The Redux framework will then take the actions and call the reducer function with the current state and the action and the reducer returns the new state. This is the only way that state can be mutated so all state manipulation functionality resides in the reducer function.

The reducer function can be divided into many reducer functions, if needed, with the Redux `combineReducers` function.

Immutable.js or immutability-helper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When updating state in React the old state mustn't be modified. A new copy must be made of the state and a change must be made in that. But this can be slow so there exist several alternatives to make that operation faster. 

The first is to use javascript carefully to always return a copy of the state. The functions `map`, `filter`, `splice` and the spread operator ... can be used to make this happen.

In this project an npm package `immutability-helper` is used to make the state changes in the reducer function. This will reuse the parts of the state javascript object that is not changed and keep the same reference to that sub object. When using this package you can always assume and rely on that the objects returned will not ever change again so parts of them can be used freely in other objects.

Another approach not used in this project is to use the npm package link:https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js/[Immutable.js] and link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-immutable[redux-immutable]. It provides immutable collections `Map`, `Set` and `List`. It also provides fromJS() and toJS() to convert from/to a nested javascript object. With all objects and sub objects as Immutable.js collections in the state the `equals` operation becomes very quick. And the ref equals === can be used to check for possible sameness. If === is true then everything in that collection is the same since nothing ever changes in an immutable object. Otherwise the Immutable.is or equals must be used to find out if the objectes are *value equal*. Use this together with shouldComponentUpdate to make very quick React components.

NOTE: Make sure to not mix javascript objects and Immutable.js collections in the state. See the Immutable.js documentation.

PureComponents and shallow prop comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As normal operation, React always calls the render function of each component and sub component starting with the App component and adds everything to a virtual DOM. It also keeps a copy of the virtual DOM from the last time it rendered everything and a smart diff algorithm is then run to find out what changed between the different versions of the virtual DOMs. These changes are then actually changed in the real DOM in the browser.

However if the props provided to the component is exactly the same as the last time, the render function doesn't even have to be called at all. The React component can be made to extend React.PureComponent. PureComponent compares the old props and the new props. If they are the same the render function will not be called. But it will only make a shallow comparison of the props so if the props contain javascript objects you can instead override the shouldComponentUpdate function of React.Component to compare the props manually.

All functionality is in Redux Actions and Reducers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All functionality in the app can be found by looking in the redux/actions/index.js and redux/reducers/index.js files. 

The development of a new feature starts with a state and then, through one or many actions, results in another state. There is no need to think about any components because they don't have any state. Just think about how the state should be updated. 

When the action/state modifying logic is right you can then make sure that every new combination of app state can be rendered correctly.

Functionality by pure functions is a very important concept to make applications less complicated and more testable.

Example of layout algorithm for nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There exist graph layout algorithms, e.g. link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/dagre[Dagre] that can operate just on data and to provide layout positions as output. 

Since node positions and width/height is entirely in the Redux state a layout action/reducer can be created that just takes the data in the state as input and provides the layout as output and then the layout feature is done. Components and connections already knows how to render themselves from the state.

[[Confirm]]
Nodes/Connections confirmed by server logic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The test websocket server (websocket-test-server.js) has a storage of nodes with UUIDs. It has a "addnode" command and it will acknowledge
the addnode command with an answer.

The test server also returns a uuid session id when a client connects.

With the Redux actions CREATE_NODE and CONFIRM_NODE the web app will keep track of which nodes have been
confirmed (i.e. acknowledged by the server) for a specific session. The nodes will have a red border if the current session id doesn't match the nodeConfirmedWithThisSessionId in the node.

A Sync button in the web app will call a function that just goes through all unconfirmed nodes and issues an `addnode` action on them.
This will in turn cause a acknowledge messages from the server and the nodes will in turn get a black border which
indicates that the node is confirmed.

This works similarly for connections.

Undo/Redo
~~~~~~~~~

The npm package `redux-undo` takes care of the undo history and provides action creators to go up and down in the undo history. Since every Redux reducer function make immutable changes to the state the old state is kept intact and can just be added to the undo history. When an Undo action is later called the state is just reset to the old state from the undo history state array by copying the reference to the state.

NOTE: Sync with a server can be tricky after Undo/Redo. If the sync is made with incremental commands s.a. `addnode` and `addconnection` the client and the server will then suddenly be out of sync. It is currently illustrated in this project.

A possible solution to this problem is to keep track of the last state the server was in and to have a resync action that takes the diff of that state and the new state and issues a series of server commands to make them in sync again. For this the npm packages `immutable` and `immutablediff` could be used.

Another solution to this problem is to always send the entire nodes/connection state from the client to the server and let the server update its state.

Yet another solution for this is to keep the nodes/connection state entirely on the server and not on the client.

Node list area
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A list of node types. List items are draggable into the editor area with HTML drag/drop. (Not supported on iOS). When drag starts a payload in the form of a JSON string is entered that contains the index of the node template to use when creating the node. The editor area accepts drops and decodes the JSON string payload to find out which node template should be used to create the node.

Nodes can also be clicked to place new nodes in the graph area.

Type checks with PropTypes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The npm package `proptypes` can be used in React component to make sure the provided props have the correct type and that all required props are given. If the check fails a warning message in the javascript console is printed. See e.g. InOutNode.js for an example.

Asserts
~~~~~~~~

Not used in project but could be very valuable to use to find bugs early.

Invariant checks can be made on state. Very valuable to check the validity of the state variables. E.g. width > 0. Format of the node objects. Correct types etc. This will catch many programming errors.

Asserts in functions to check input/output will also make it easier to catch errors.

TypeScript
~~~~~~~~~~~

TypeScript is JavaScript with extra type declarations. It will check
types with a compiler. It will compile/transpile to JavaSCript but
that is done behind the scenes in this project setup.

Example of using TypeScript can be foound in the component BezierCurve.tsx. Using TypeScript interfaces or classes 
can e.g. be used as a way to check the types of the props and which props are required and which are optional.

The .tsx extension is TypeScript with JSX.

Using the .tsx extension and TypeScript automatically use the TypeScript compiler to check for types.

TypeScript is not used in all of this project. Can be a good idea.
Enforces types in arguments and vars.
Takes care of new functionality in javascript and transpiles it to older syntax which will run in more browsers.

Websocket test server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The websocket test server is a simple Node.js application and is started with `node websocket-test-server.js`.

It opens a websocket on localhost:1337 and when a client connects it replies with a `session id` as an UUID.

It will keep a collection of `nodes` as a list of node ids.

It will keep a colletion of `connections` as a list of objects with fromNodeId and toNodeId.

The client can send commands to the web socket and get answers.
Only one command can be sent at a time. The next command can be sent when the answer from the last one has been sent back in the websocket.

Commands:

- `addnode`
- `addconnection`
- `deletenode`
- `deleteconnection`
- `getgraph` Returns a JSON object with all nodes and connections

Websocket test server sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The client actions `CREATE_NODE`, `CONNECT_PORTS` and `DELETE_SELECTED` will send commands to the test server to keep it in sync.

The `Server representation` area to the right in the client will show exactly what was returned by the `getgraph` command from the server. This way you can check that the sync went well. You can also check that new and future sync algorithms work as expected.

NOTE: Client and Server will currently get out of sync after a Undo/Redo operation. This error can be investigated by looking at the Server Representation area.
